# Hello World Git demo

A fairly simple Hello World program to demonstrate the most frequently used 
commands in Git.

This is a Java 21 project. Or at least it's Java 12 or Java 13 with preview 
features enabled, or Java 14 or higher, on account of the Switch-Case expression 
in `org.example.HelloWorld`.

This project is closed off to Hacktoberfest. However, check out my Toy Examples 
repository.
